        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Greetings! I am a skilled DevOps Engineer with a solid foundation in AWS Cloud services. My expertise lies in the seamless integration of DevOps methodologies, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, and cutting-edge cloud technologies. With a total work experience of 8 years and 4 months, I bring a wealth of knowledge to the table.

My journey in the tech industry began with a strong focus on AWS Cloud, where I have garnered 2 years of hands-on experience. This proficiency allows me to design, implement, and manage cloud infrastructures with efficiency and precision. Alongside my AWS expertise, I have spent around 2 years in Cloud support roles, which has enriched my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of cloud ecosystems.

I am passionate about optimizing development workflows, enhancing deployment pipelines, and ensuring the scalability and security of cloud-based applications. My holistic experience empowers me to drive collaboration between development and operations teams, fostering a culture of agility and innovation.

I am excited to contribute my expertise to projects that demand a strategic approach to DevOps, backed by years of practical exposure to cloud technologies. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of elevating your technological landscape together."</p>
